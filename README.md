Raspberry PI with EnviroHat Python Flask Service

Python flask web server that reads the sensors from a EnviroHat.
It does store the readings into an sqlite3 database.
Two ways of showing the readings, via the index page, where readings will be update each 10 seconds, and a dashboard page with graphics of them readings.
Also available is the input of two connected web cameras if available.

A password.py file is needed to secure access to sensible pages and commands.

Enjoy,
